## Description

When you conceptualize the the ideal data model for a REDCap project which
contains Repeating Instrument(s), you probably think of a multi-table model
(_aka_, a relational model). You might expect that the non-repeating instruments
may constitute one table that would be related to Repeating Instruments tables
via a one-to-many relationship. Unfortunately, that is not how the data is
exported either via CSV or API call. In reality, the data is delivered as one
table with all possible fields; this has the effect of nesting the output table
in a way that is not useful in most statistical analysis software.

The normalized data can be retrieved by downloading repeating instruments
individually then doing a little data munging or by writing a few custom
parameters in a series of API calls (then doing more data munging), but this is
a lot of extra steps that can make reproducible research more difficult.

REDCapRITS is a programmatic solution to handle the problem without all the
extra steps of downloading each instrument one-by-one.

### Illustration

Consider this mocked-up data exported from a REDCap project with repeating
instruments. The data contains information on a subset of cars in R's built-in
`mtcars` dataset [1]. Within the table there is also a repeating instrument,
*sales*, which has sales transaction data for some of those cars.

You can see that the data from the non-repeating form (primary table) is
interlaced with the data in the repeating form, creating a checkerboard pattern.
In order to do analysis, the data must be
[_normalized_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) and then
the tables rejoined. Normalization would result in two tables: 1) a *primary*
table and 2) a *sale* table. The normalized tables would look like this:

**Primary table**

Suppose you would like to do some analysis such as sale price by make of car or
find the most popular color for each model. To do so, you can
[_join_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29) the tables together.
After inner joining the *primary* table to the *sale* table on `car_id` and
selecting only the fields you are interested in, your resulting analytic dataset
might look something like this:

| car_id|make     |model    |price    |color |customer |
|------:|:--------|:--------|:--------|:-----|:--------|
|      1|AMC      |Javelin  |12000.50 |1     |Bob      |
|      1|AMC      |Javelin  |13750.77 |3     |Sue      |
|      1|AMC      |Javelin  |15004.57 |2     |Kim      |
|      3|Camaro   |Z28      |7800.00  |2     |Janice   |
|      3|Camaro   |Z28      |8000.00  |3     |Tim      |
|      4|Chrysler |Imperial |7500.00  |1     |Jim      |
|      7|Duster   |360      |8756.40  |4     |Sarah    |
|      7|Duster   |360      |6800.88  |2     |Pablo    |
|      7|Duster   |360      |8888.88  |1     |Erica    |
|      7|Duster   |360      |970.00   |4     |Juan     |
|     10|Merc     |230      |7800.98  |2     |Ted      |
|     10|Merc     |230      |7954.00  |1     |Quentin  |
|     10|Merc     |230      |6800.55  |3     |Sharon   |

Such a join can be accomplished numerous ways. Just to name a few:

- [`dplyr::*_join`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.5/topics/join)
- [`sqldf::sqldf`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sqldf/versions/0.4-11/topics/sqldf)
- [`base::merge`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.0/topics/merge)

## Instructions

### Installation

First you must install the package. To do so, execute the following in your R console:

```r
install.packages("REDCapRITS")
```

To install the development version, run the following code:

```r
if (!requireNamespace(remotes, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SpectrumHealthResearch/REDCapRITS/R")
```

### Usage

After the package is installed, follow these instructions:

1. Download the record dataset and metadata (data dictionary). This can
be accomplished by several methods:
    - Using the API. Check with your REDCap administrator for details.
    - Exporting the data from the web interface by selecting *CSV / Microsoft Excel (raw data)*.
    - Exporting the data from the web interface by selecting *R Statistical Software*.
      If you use this method, you may run the R script supplied by REDCap prior to splitting the data.
    - **Do NOT** export from the web interface with the *CSV / Microsoft Excel (labels)* option.
      This will not work with `REDCapRITS`.
1. Call the function, pointing it to your record dataset and metadata
`data.frame`s, `httr` responses, or JSON character vectors. You may need to load
the package via `library()` or `require()`.

### Examples

Here is an example usage in conjuction with an API call to your REDCap instance:

```r
library(RCurl)

# Get the records
records <- postForm(
    uri = api_url,     # Supply your site-specific URI
    token = api_token, # Supply your own API token
    content = 'record',
    format = 'json',
    returnFormat = 'json'
)

# Get the metadata
metadata <- postForm(
    uri = api_url,     # Supply your site-specific URI
    token = api_token, # Supply your own API token
    content = 'metadata',
    format = 'json'
)

# Convert exported JSON strings into a list of data.frames
REDCapRITS::REDCap_split(records, metadata)
```

And here is an example of usage when downloading a REDCap export of the raw data
(not labelled!) manually from your REDCap web interface:

```r
# Get the records
records <- read.csv("/path/to/data/ExampleProject_DATA_2018-06-03_1700.csv")

# Get the metadata
metadata <- read.csv("/path/to/data/ExampleProject_DataDictionary_2018-06-03.csv")

# Split the tables
REDCapRITS::REDCap_split(records, metadata)
```

REDCapRITS also works with the data export script (a.k.a., *syntax file*)
supplied by REDCap. Here is an example of its usage:

```r
# Run the data export script supplied by REDCap. 
# This will create a data.frame of your records called 'data'
source("/path/to/data/ExampleProject_R_2018-06-03_1700.r", chdir = TRUE)

# Get the metadata
metadata <- read.csv("/path/to/metadata/ExampleProject_DataDictionary_2018-06-03.csv")

# Split the tables
REDCapRITS::REDCap_split(data, metadata)
```

## About REDCap

This code was written for [REDCap electronic data capture
tools](https://projectredcap.org/) [2]. Code for this project was tested on the
REDCap instance hosted at Spectrum Health, Grand Rapids, MI. REDCap (Research
Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to support
data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for
validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export
procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common
statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external
sources.
